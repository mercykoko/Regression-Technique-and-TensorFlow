House Prices: Advanced Regression Technique and TensorFlow (DeepLearning)

Today, Data Science is nearly everywhere. Data science in the business domain includes the rate at which the business proliferates, using various models for reason I used linear regression and deep leaning to predict sales prices and practice feature engineering. When you ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad, this dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a fence. The goal is to estimate the probability at which someone will quote the price rather than the features of their dream house.


Regression-Technique
Ridge is linear least squares model with l2 regularization (using squared difference).

RidgeCV is Ridge regression with built-in cross-validation.

Lasso is Linear Model trained with l1 regularization (using module).

LassoCV is Lasso linear model with iterative fitting along a regularization path.

Random Forest is usually good in cases with many features.

And XGBoost is a library which is very popular lately and usually gives good results.
